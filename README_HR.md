# Assignment Overview

### Candidate: Hadrien Rudich

### Position: Full Stack Developer Intern

### Version Control Practices

- **Branch Management:** Created dedicated branches throughout the project to isolate changes. This included performing Pull Requests and Merges. While of limited use due to working alone, I think it demonstrated my versioning practices.

### Coding Standards

- **Linting/Formatting:** Implemented linting and formatting habits using an industry standard: eslint-config-airbnb.

### Code Structure and React Practices

- **Project Restructuring:** Restructured the project to ensure proper separation of concerns, making it more modular and easier to build upon.
- **Custom Hooks:** Created various custom hooks to meet the needs of the application and improve React usability.
- **Type Safety:** Improved types definition throughout the project for increased type safety.

### UI and Styling

- **Styling:** Added styling using Tailwind, supplemented with two graphic assets libraries for added visual appeal. I decided to keep it simple and avoided going overboard with the assignment.

### Performance Optimization

- **API Call Management:** Considered adding API call results to a local state for easier manipulation, but decided against it. Instead, I went with a debounce on keystrokes to keep the search dynamic while limiting API calls, optimizing performance and cost.

## Error Handling

- **Minimalistic Approach:** Adopted a minimalistic approach with mostly try/catch blocks and console.log statements for error handling. While not the best practice, it's still a decent starting point considering the nature of the homework.

### Additional Packages

I tried to limit the use of external packages to the best of my ability, here is a breakdown of what I picked:

- **Formatting/Linting:** Installed packages like Prettier, ESLint, and eslint-config-airbnb to maintain code quality and consistency.
- **Graphic Assets:** Utilized packages such as react-icons and react-spinners to enhance the UI's visual appeal.

## Final Word

Thank you for entrusting me with this assignment and for giving me an opportunity to show you my worth. The experience overall was fun and I tried my best to remain within the scope of the homework. There is so much more that could have been done, but I focused on what I deemed most important and relevant.
